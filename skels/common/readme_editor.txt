FTL Ship Editor - Superluminal 2
  http://github.com/kartoFlane/superluminal2/


About

	Superluminal2 is a ship editor for the game FTL: Faster Than Light,
	and the expansion, FTL: Advanced Edition.
	  http://www.subsetgames.com/ftl.html

	The editor provides a layer of abstraction over the game's files,
	visually representing the data in the same form as in the game, making
	the task of creating a functional ship much easier and less daunting.



Requirements

	Java (1.6 or higher)
	  http://www.java.com/en/download/
	FTL: AE (1.5.10 or higher, Windows/OSX/Linux, Steam/GOG/Standalone)
	  http://www.ftlgame.com/


Setup

	Extract the files from the archive anywhere.

	On the first run, you may be prompted to locate your FTL resources.
	Location of these resouces depends on your version of the game.
	
	For versions 1.0.1 - 1.5.13, you will need to select the 'data.dat'
	file in the 'resources' folder in FTL's installation directory.

	For versions 1.6.1 and above, you will need to select the `ftl.dat`
	file, which is located directly in FTL's installation directory.

	On OSX, you can select 'FTL.app', since the resources are inside it.

	In most cases, this should be located automatically, and the editor
	will only ask you for confirmation.
	
	The editor reads data directly from the game's files, so any mods you
	have installed will show up in the editor.
