[Superluminal for Hyperspace](https://www.subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=36060) which added support for some
features added to FTL by [FTL: Hyperspace](https://subsetgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=35095).

See [changelog](https://github.com/blizzarchon/superluminal2/blob/master/skels/common/readme_changelog.txt)

#### __________

Superluminal2 is a ship editor for the game [FTL: Faster Than Light](https://www.subsetgames.com/ftl.html).
The editor provides a layer of abstraction over the game's files, visually representing the data in the same form as in the game, making the task of creating a functional ship much easier and less daunting.

It is a complete rewrite of, and successor to, the original [Superluminal](https://github.com/kartoFlane/Superluminal) editor.
