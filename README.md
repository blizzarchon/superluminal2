Superluminal2
=============

Superluminal2 is a ship editor for the game FTL: Faster Than Light, and the expansion, FTL: Advanced Edition.
The editor provides a layer of abstraction over the game's files, making the task of creating a functional ship much easier and less daunting.

It is a complete rewrite of, and successor to, the original editor ([Superluminal](https://github.com/kartoFlane/Superluminal)).

To **download** the compiled program, go [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/superluminal2/files/Superluminal2/)

If you're looking to get a hang of how the program works, [readme_developers](https://github.com/kartoFlane/superluminal2/blob/master/readme_developers.txt) roughly outlines the repo's structure and purpose behind all of the packages in the source code folder.
